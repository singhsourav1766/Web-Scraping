Besides performance (which you can find in detail from the video below), the other two areas that left us mighty impressed are thermal management and display quality.

With an 18-inch display the ASUS ROG Strix Scar 18 (that's a mouthful), should be your weapon of choice, especially if you are on the lookout for a performance machine with an Nvidia RTX 4080 under the hood. The blazing fast GPU is well accompanied by a 13th Gen Intel Core i9 HX series processor and 32GB of RAM. Your games will not only run at butter-smooth frame rates, they will also load faster with 32GB of DDR5 memory rated at 4800MHz. The large 18-inch display allowed ASUS some additional room inside the chassis, as a result, while the laptop has a large footprint, it's not excessively thick or heavy for an 18-inch top specced gaming laptop. Our only possible crib against the laptop is the display resolution which is limited to FHD+ (1920 x 1200) on this particular model. So you will be a bit short of the 1440p standard which is considered as the sweet spot, given the GeForce RTX 4080 under the hood.MORE SPECIFICATIONSProcessor : 13th Gen Intel Core i9-13980HX 24 core processor with 2.2 GHz clock speedDisplay : 18″ (1920 x 1200) screen, 165 Hz refresh rateOS : Windows 11 HomeMemory : 32 GB DDR5GB RAM & 1 TB SSDGraphics Processor : 12 GB DDR6 NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 Graphics cardBody : 294 x 399 x 23 mm dimension & 3.1 kg weightPrice : ₹ 279,990\",\n",

This combination delivers unbeatable value in the high-performance gaming laptop segment, the Core i7 + RTX 4060 combination fits like a glove for 1440p gaming at high FPS.
